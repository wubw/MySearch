**Substrate Search Service**
Along with the innovation of BigFunnel Exchange evolved the query stack through an API and orchestration layer called **Substrate Search Service (3S)** to unify the search experience across all search scenarios like mobile, Outlook, Outlook Web Access (OWA) etc. The query orchestration layer leveraged an existing Bing technology called XAP (orchestrator) to orchestrate the nuances of the query layer like language detection, word breaking, fan-out, merge, sort, relevance, jitter etc. and build an API framework on top of it that was consumable by partners.

RAC = Restricted Access Control, CAP = Conditional Access Policy. These are security policy that requires 3S to call SharePoint to determine if a user has access to the site before they return items to the user as part of Copilot scenario.
